# Origin

This `docker/` directory is pinched from the main Apache Superset repository.

We need it for bootstrapping the Docker container(s) (see [our Dockerfile](../Dockerfile))

The code here was taken from commit
 [1cc726364a5f4ec61bb8af673cc0cd27c044ba87](https://github.com/apache/superset/commit/1cc726364a5f4ec61bb8af673cc0cd27c044ba87)
 of the `apache/superset` GitHub repository.
